# LHBDC
Learned Hierarchical Bi-Directional Compression
-- Developed a video compression and decompression system in Python using motion estimation and bi-directional compensation. Leveraged RAFT optical flow for frame-to-frame motion estimation and implemented residual encoding to enhance compression efficiency. Integrated key frame encoding/decoding, along with multi-frame compensation for accurate video reconstruction. The system utilizes a custom approach inspired by LHBDC for video compression, with a Tkinter interface for handling video file input and output, and employs pickle for saving compressed data.
